# swag-chat
Voice wrapper for ChatGPT

## Setup
1. Clone repo locally
2. Install python
3. Import necessary packages (flask and openai)
4. Add your own API key to generate.py
5. Run app.py
6. Open your browser and go to the url that appears when you run app.py (http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

## Usage
Press "Start Listening" before talking
Press "Stop Listening" to submit input
Press "Clear conversation" to clear conversation context
There is also a 4 second timeout after silence. If you find that annoying, lmk and I can change it.

## Notes
In the future I want to make it work like siri/alexa by giving it a trigger word and doing away with the buttons
I have only tested this on MacOS using Chrome and Python 3.9
